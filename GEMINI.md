Great! You're building a modern, feature-rich, blazing-fast flat listing platform for Bangladesh using powerful tools like Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase Auth, MongoDB, Cloudinary, and more.

Here’s a detailed step-by-step guideline to complete this project efficiently and professionally:

🔧 Tech Stack Overview
Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, React Hook Form, Yup, Redux Toolkit

Backend: Firebase (Authentication + Email verification), MongoDB Atlas (via Mongoose)

Storage: Next-Cloudinary (Images/Videos)

Payments: Manual (bKash/Nagad/Rocket, store receipts)

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), MongoDB Atlas (Cloud DB)

✅ STEP-BY-STEP DEVELOPMENT PLAN
🔹 Phase 1: Project Setup
Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-next-app@latest flat-finder --app --ts --tailwind
cd flat-finder
Install Essential Packages

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers yup next-cloudinary firebase mongoose axios
Set Up Folder Structure

bash
Copy
Edit
/app
/(public routes)
/dashboard (layout + private)
/components
/lib (utils, firebase, db)
/store (Redux Toolkit)
/types
/hooks
/middlewares (auth middleware)
🔹 Phase 2: Authentication (Firebase + Email Verification)
Setup Firebase Project

Enable Email/Password, and Google Auth.

Enable Email Verification in Firebase console.

Firebase Auth Code Setup

Create lib/firebase.ts and initialize Firebase.

Create auth context for global user state.

Add useAuth hook for login/register/logout.

Registration Flow

Use React Hook Form + Yup for validation.

After registration, send email verification:

ts
Copy
Edit
await sendEmailVerification(user);
Block login if not verified.

Role Handling

Store user role (buyer/seller/admin/tenant) in Firestore or MongoDB.

Restrict Admin to specific email.

🔹 Phase 3: State Management (Redux Toolkit)
Store authenticated user + role in Redux.

Manage UI states, listing filters, dashboard states centrally.

ts
Copy
Edit
// store/userSlice.ts
interface UserState {
currentUser: User | null;
role: 'admin' | 'buyer' | 'seller' | 'tenant' | null;
}
🔹 Phase 4: Listings & Database (MongoDB + Mongoose)
MongoDB Atlas Setup

Create lib/dbConnect.ts for connecting to DB.

Schema Design

FlatListing (type: rent/sale/bachelor, ownerId, isPremium, etc.)

Booking (buyerId, listingId, date)

Complaint (userId, targetId, reason)

Warning/Badge

Payment (type, amount, referenceId)

API Routes (app/api)

/api/listings, /api/bookings, /api/complaints, /api/payments, etc.
